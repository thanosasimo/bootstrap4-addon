### Aspect ratio
For each bootstrap breakpoint adds `.ar-$breakpoint-#number ` class.  
The #number is between 5-230 with step 5.  

e.g.  
Class `.ar-md-20` will add a 20% padding-top css rule to the given element.  
This will effectthe height of the element depending the width, so it will maintain its aspect ratio.
